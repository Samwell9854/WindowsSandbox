Copy both the "bypass_RunMe.bat" & "RunMe.ps1" scripts into the folder which you want to search for files with too long path names.
NOT RECOMMENDED: Placing the scripts directly in the C: drive will scan the whole system. This can take a very long time to complete.

Run the RunMe.bat to start the search.
Output in same directory as scripts in file "list.txt".
